# LOKI CONTINUITY LEDGER - HIGHTECH DNA SYNCHRONIZATION

## Mission Objective
Apply the exact source code logic from `K:\LANDING HIGHTECH.txt` to `VOICES IA` for bit-perfect aesthetic alignment.

## DNA Extraction Details (from K:\LANDING HIGHTECH.txt)
- **Grid Opacity:** `0.03` (Not 0.08 as previous guessed).
- **Logo Hierarchy:** `h-40 md:h-56` (Master uses a physically larger logo than the "Voice IA" previous scaled-down version).
- **Title Scaling:** `text-6xl md:text-8xl` with `tracking-tighter`.
- **Core Colors:** `tech.accent: #00f2ff`, `tech.warning: #ff8c00`, `tech.base: #050505`.
- **Spacing:** `mb-40` for header, `mb-16` for logo-container.
- **Tech Box:** `4px` corner width (Not 6px).

## Task Queue (Phase 4: Implementation)
- [/] Synchronize `style.css` with Master CSS (Grid, Scanline, Tech-Box corners)
- [ ] Synchronize `App.tsx` Hero structure with Master (Proportions, Labels, Logo Scale)
- [ ] Synchronize `tailwind.config.js` with Master extend rules

## Working Memory
Applying the EXACT pixel values from HIGHTECH.txt. Re-enforcing the large-scale logo (`h-56`) as it is the corporate standard in the provided file.
